####################

Welcome to the ezmsg documentation! 

ezmsg is a **highly performant messaging and multiprocessing framework** designed for building modular, high-performance signal processing pipelines. It is built in pure Python with no dependencies, making it easy to install and use.

|ezmsg_logo_small| What is ezmsg?
**********************************

 ``ezmsg`` (n) - "easy message"

 ezmsg is a high-performance execution engine and multiprocessing backend for executing a directed acyclic graph of stream-processing units via a publish-subscribe pattern facilitated by shared memory transfer with zero-copy messaging between composable nodes written in pure Python with no dependencies or stated application space.

ezmsg implements much of the LabGraph API (with a few notable differences), and owes a lot of its design to the LabGraph developers/project. Afterall, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

The ezmsg library eases the creation of modular systems whose elements can be switched out easily. Consider the use case of building a processing pipeline where you will be experimenting with adding and removing steps until you find an optimal workflow. ezmsg allows you to easily separate each step into a discrete entity and piece together a workflow from those entities. Check out the helpful :doc:`tutorial series <tutorials/content-tutorials>` to see how this works.

.. `Examples <https://github.com/ezmsg-org/ezmsg/tree/main/examples>`_ to see how this works.


|ezmsg_logo_small| Quick start
**************************************

For a detailed description of the installation process and getting started with ezmsg, please refer to the :doc:`Getting Started guide <tutorials/start>`.

But in short, if you have Python 3.10+ installed, you can install ezmsg via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ezmsg

Then in your Python script or Jupyter notebook, you can import ezmsg like so:

.. code-block:: python

    import ezmsg.core as ez

If you would like to develop with ezmsg or contribute to the project, you can follow the steps outlined in the :doc:`Developer Guide <developer/content-developer>`.

If you would like to build the documentation locally, please refer to the instructions found in :ref:`documentation_building`. 

A substantial list of extensions exist for ezmsg. One can install extensions as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ezmsg[extension_name]


See :doc:`Extensions <extensions/content-extensions>` for more information.

|ezmsg_logo_small| Documentation Overview
*******************************************

This documentation is designed to help you get started with ezmsg, understand its architecture, and learn how to use it effectively in your projects.

Give it a try with our :doc:`specially created tutorial series <tutorials/content-tutorials>` and see how it can simplify your signal processing needs.

If you don't want to download and install anything just yet, you can check out this `Google Colab page <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gHspPyS-lIUpb9zKFzgmBqAZcUPCINSh?usp=sharing>`_ for an example ezmsg notebook to experiment with. It's a little dated, but it should give you a good idea of how to use ezmsg in a Jupyter notebook environment.

These are a few high-level topics to help you learn more about ezmsg and the ezmsg ecosystem.

|ezmsg_logo_small| Why use ezmsg?
***********************************

Why use ezmsg over a comparable tool? ezmsg is extremely fast and uses Python's ``multiprocessing.shared_memory`` module to facilitate efficient message passing without C++ or any compilation/build tooling. It is easy to install and contains less boilerplate than similar frameworks. It also provides a framework for building processing pipelines while keeping best practices in mind.
