How to get data from a device in ezmsg?
###########################################

ezmsg provides several built-in Units to interface with common data sources, such as cameras, microphones, and files. To get data from a device, you typically use a specific Unit designed for that device type.

For example, you can use:

- `ezmsg-blackrock` for Blackrock neural data acquisition systems.
- `ezmsg-lsl` for Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) devices. LSL, in particular, supports a wide range of devices through its ecosystem.
